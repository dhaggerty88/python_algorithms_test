# This file contains the definition and unit test of the print_depth() function, which prints
# the depth of all dictionary keys found in a provided (potentially nested) dictionary.
#
# NOTE: The question simply asked me to print all keys and their depth, BUT the sample output
#       from the problem was formatted in a very specific way. I decided to match the sample output
#       even though it made my code more complex, because I like to give the client what they expect :)
